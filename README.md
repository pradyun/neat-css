# Neat CSS
A set of small CSS modules for my web projects.

## Guiding Philosophy
- "Keep it simple silly!"
   - Do not over-complicate things. Life is hard as it is.
- "Mobile Devices are important."
   - Responsive Modules!! :smile:
- "HTML is meant to describe content and only content."
   - Do not let layout and styling leak into HTML code.
   - Layout and Styling is completely the responsibility of CSS.
   - Most kinds of grids won't work with this. :P
- "Travel Light."
   - Don't force bloating CSS with extra, unused things in the final site.
- "Every web project is unique"
    - Module should not impose any styles and should be easy to style (preferably without overriding).
